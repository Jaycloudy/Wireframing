# Wireframing

## What is Wireframing?

Wireframing is the process of creating a basic visual guide that represents the layout or structure of a website or app. Think of it like the **blueprint of a building** — it doesn’t show the final look, but it shows how everything will be placed and work.

Wireframes are typically simple drawings that include boxes, labels, and placeholders for images or text.

## Why is Wireframing Important?

Wireframing is an essential step in the design process for several reasons:

- **Clarifies Structure**: Helps define the layout and hierarchy of content.
- **Saves Time**: Detects usability issues early, before development begins.
- **Improves Communication**: Makes it easier for designers, developers, and stakeholders to understand the product vision.
- **Encourages Feedback**: Wireframes can be shared early to gather feedback before investing in full design or code.

## 🔑 Key Elements of a Wireframe

Understanding the core elements in a wireframe helps you create a clean, functional, and user-friendly design. Here are the main parts:

### 🧱 1. Layout Structure

This refers to the **overall arrangement** of content on the screen.

- It shows **where things go**: header at the top, content in the middle, footer at the bottom.
- Think of it like a house floor plan: you see where each room is before decorating.

**Example:**  
In a travel booking app, the layout might have:
- A header with the logo and search bar
- A middle section with destination cards
- A footer with navigation tabs

---

### 🧭 2. Navigation

This is how users **move between different pages** or sections of the app.

- Includes things like **menus, buttons, links, and tabs**.
- Good navigation makes the app **easy to use and explore**.

**Example:**  
A bottom tab with icons for:
- Home 🏠
- Search 🔍
- Bookings 📆
- Profile 👤

---

### 📝 3. Content Placement

This is about **what information goes where**.

- Helps prioritize what users see first.
- Important content should be more visible (top of screen or larger).

**Example:**  
On a hotel detail page:
- Big image at the top
- Name and price right below
- Description and reviews underneath

---

### ⚙️ 4. Functionality

This covers **what users can do** on each screen.

- Includes **buttons, forms, filters, sliders**, etc.
- Represents the **actions users take**, like searching, logging in, or booking.

**Example:**  
- A “Book Now” button on a property page
- A date picker to choose check-in and check-out dates
- A sign-in form with email/password fields

---

These elements **work together** to make sure the wireframe is both useful and usable before adding visuals and colors.
