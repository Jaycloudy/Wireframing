# Wireframing

## What is Wireframing?

Wireframing is the process of creating a basic visual guide that represents the layout or structure of a website or app. Think of it like the **blueprint of a building** — it doesn’t show the final look, but it shows how everything will be placed and work.

Wireframes are typically simple drawings that include boxes, labels, and placeholders for images or text.

## Why is Wireframing Important?

Wireframing is an essential step in the design process for several reasons:

- **Clarifies Structure**: Helps define the layout and hierarchy of content.
- **Saves Time**: Detects usability issues early, before development begins.
- **Improves Communication**: Makes it easier for designers, developers, and stakeholders to understand the product vision.
- **Encourages Feedback**: Wireframes can be shared early to gather feedback before investing in full design or code.
